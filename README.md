Work by Yilin Song

1) I chose 1 because automated testing is too time consuming for local execution. Github action enables me to automate the pipeline of build, test, and deployment. I can build and test every pull request to my repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production, which is extremely useful and saves time.
2) No
3) No, because unit testing cannot evaluate how individual components interact with one another at the application level.The message features include message input, message sending, and message verification. Because it involves a variety of factors. Unit testing is not the best option.
4) Yes, I'll utilize unit testing to determine the maximum message length. Because it is straightforward and does not interact with other components.
